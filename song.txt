I remember that time we were sippin' on wine
I could see it in your eyes, you were feeling alive
Why tell you I was good, why the fuck would I lie? (Why?)
I remember saying twice, "Baby, I shouldn't drive"
"I should let you hold the keys, baby, take 'em inside"
If you'd taken my advice, maybe then you'd survived, yeah
I've been looking at the sky all night and ain't see shit
Thinking how you died, but you said I could be shit
Now I'm on my grind, baby, look at me now
Look at me now, yeah
